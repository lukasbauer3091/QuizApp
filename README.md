# Quiz app using React and Typescript

This project was made to get familiar with Typescript. It uses the opentdb API to get Quiz question/answers and was built from the default React-create-app. This project will be modified in the future to use Preact instead of React, as well as for me to continue to develop TS, JS, and CSS skills.

## Available Scripts

Run using:

### `npm start`
